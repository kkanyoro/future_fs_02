CLIENT LEAD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (MINI CRM) - STEP-BY-STEP WORKFLOW

## PHASE 1: ENVIRONMENT & DATABASE SETUP

1.1 Project Structure:
- Create a main folder "Mini-CRM".
- Inside, create "backend" and "frontend" folders.
- Inside "backend", run: npm init -y
- Install: npm install express mysql2 dotenv cors jsonwebtoken bcryptjs

1.2 Database (MySQL):
- Create database: mini_crm_db
- Create table: admins (id, username, email, password_hash, created_at)
- Create table: leads (id, name, email, phone, source, status, created_at)
- Create table: notes (id, lead_id, admin_id, content, created_at)
- Set FK: notes.lead_id -> leads.id
- Set FK: notes.admin_id -> admins.id

1.3 Environment Configuration (.env):
- Create .env file in /backend.
- Add: DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_NAME, JWT_SECRET, PORT=5000.

## PHASE 2: BACKEND API DEVELOPMENT (NODE.JS + EXPRESS)

2.1 Database Connection (config/db.js):
- Set up mysql2 connection pool.
- Export the pool to use in other files.

2.2 Lead Capture API (Public):
- Route: POST /api/public/leads
- Task: Takes name, email, phone from website form and inserts into 'leads' table.
- Set default status to 'new'.

2.3 Admin Auth API (Private):
- Route: POST /api/auth/login
- Task: Compare email/password (bcrypt). If match, sign a JWT token.
- Middleware (middleware/auth.js): Verify JWT for all protected admin routes.

2.4 Lead Management API (Private):
- Route: GET /api/admin/leads (Fetch all leads, order by newest first).
- Route: PATCH /api/admin/leads/:id (Update status: 'new', 'contacted', 'converted').

2.5 Notes API (Private):
- Route: POST /api/admin/leads/:id/notes (Insert new note for a specific lead).
- Route: GET /api/admin/leads/:id/notes (Fetch note history for a specific lead).

## PHASE 3: FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT (REACT.JS)

3.1 React Setup:
- In /frontend, run: npx create-react-app .
- Install: npm install axios react-router-dom

3.2 API Service (src/services/api.js):
- Create axios instance with base URL (http://localhost:5000).
- Interceptor: Automatically add JWT token from localStorage to headers.

3.3 Login Page (src/pages/Login.js):
- Simple form for admin credentials.
- Store JWT in localStorage on successful login.
- Redirect to /dashboard.

3.4 Dashboard (src/pages/Dashboard.js):
- Use useEffect to call GET /api/admin/leads.
- Display leads in a clean Table.
- Add "Update Status" dropdown for each lead.

3.5 Lead Details & Notes (src/components/LeadModal.js):
- Create a modal that pops up when clicking a lead.
- Show lead contact info and a list of previous notes.
- Form to "Add a new follow-up note".

## PHASE 4: TESTING & FINAL POLISH

4.1 API Testing:
- Use Postman to test lead submission (Public).
- Use Postman to test Admin Login and Lead Updates (Private).

4.2 UI/UX Polish:
- Add "Success" and "Error" toasts/notifications.
- Add simple cards for "Total Leads" and "Conversion Rate %".

4.3 Documentation (README.md):
- Write clear steps on how to:
1. Run the SQL script.
2. Set up the .env file.
3. Run 'npm install' and 'npm start' for both folders.
